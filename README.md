# flareon6 solutions

This repo contains files I created during the flareon 6 CTF to serve everybodies curiosity.

3 - solved using a XPosed module

5 - solved mostly by binary patching and reverse engineering, but a little py script to dump the binary is included

6 - made me go nuts, wrote a reflection based loader and many many tests to solve this

7 - very interesting construct using python, the linear algebra stuff was a bit tricky but solveable using Z3

8 - solved with an iNES IDA Loader, FCEUX and love for code

9 - twisted min games in x86 asm, solved using IDA and Z3
